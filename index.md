Bonjour! Greetings from Geneva.

My name is Zhiye Yang.

2nd year Master's student @ IHEID

I study Global Health, joyfully most of the time.

But for some reason, I was lured into this class: Social Network Theories and Methods.

Tiptoeing through a whole semester's "inception" of social network theories and R markdowns.

I now can say proudly that I can do social network analysis and R coding.
